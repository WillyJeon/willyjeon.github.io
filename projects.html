          <h3>Doodle Day</h3>
          <p>
            This game was made for a 24-hour game jam hosted by Wolfjaw studios. I was a part of a 5 person team and was the technical artist for the game. 
            We used Unity as our engine used its Universal Render Pipeline.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Created the CRT shader used to give the game a more retro feeling</li>
            <li>Created a randomized planet generation shader to create multiple different patterns for each planet</li>
            <li>Made animations for the boot up, screen shake, and the BONK sprite</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Helpless</h3>
          <a href="./designdocs/helplessdoc.html"><h4 id="under">Design Doc</h4></a>
          <p>
            This game was made for the two week Pirate Software game jam which set the theme to be spreading. Our team's thought was to make the experience of the art exhibit called "Can't Help Myself". 
            I was a part of a 5 person team where I mainly took care of the basic AI for the npcs as well as the technical art.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Basic shaders</li>

            I joined in on this project during the summer after my junior year, filling in a spot as a Technical Artist. This was the first project 
            that I worked on where I was a full on Technical Artist.

            This game is mainly inspired by manwhas and webtoons like Solo Leveling and Overgeared.
            Currently the design document is being written. You can check out the current progress of the document with the link below.
