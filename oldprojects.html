        <h3>Nebulicious</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to Nebulicious, your one-stop shop for all donuts in the galaxy. 
          You are the sole chef and must beam up ingredients to prepare donuts for your hungry customers. 
          Don't be late with their orders. 
          I took part in Society of Play's Hexcode game jam in a team of 6 as a Technical Artist.

        <h3>Microcosm</h3>
        <p>
          Microcosm is a short game where the player goes through a set of daily tasks which will later turn into the player needing to find their medication as 
          effects of their schizophrenia start to occur. I took part in Aesthetician Lab's 2 day game jam, where the theme was "Free Him". I thought of the idea 
          to focus on a more mental approach rather than trying to escape captivity. I worked with one other person where we collaborated in designing the game and 
          how the player will progress throughout it. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Used: Unity and Blender</li>

          <h3>Doodle Day</h3>
          <p>
            This game was made for a 24-hour game jam hosted by Wolfjaw studios. I was a part of a 5 person team and was the technical artist for the game. 
            We used Unity as our engine used its Universal Render Pipeline.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Created the CRT shader used to give the game a more retro feeling</li>
            <li>Created a randomized planet generation shader to create multiple different patterns for each planet</li>
            <li>Made animations for the boot up, screen shake, and the BONK sprite</li>

          <a href="./designdocs/helplessdoc.html"><h4 id="under">Design Doc</h4></a>
          <p>
            This game was made for the two week Pirate Software game jam which set the theme to be spreading. Our team's thought was to make the experience of the art exhibit called "Can't Help Myself". 
            I was a part of a 5 person team where I mainly took care of the basic AI for the npcs as well as the technical art.
          </p>

            <li>Basic shaders</li>
            <li>Implemented animations</li>

          <h3>Changeling VR</h3>
          <p>
            I joined in on this project during the summer after my junior year, filling in a spot as a Technical Artist. This was the first project 
            that I worked on where I was a full on Technical Artist.

          <h3>Gate Crash (Work in Progress)</h3>
          <p>
            This game is mainly inspired by manwhas and webtoons like Solo Leveling and Overgeared.
            Currently the design document is being written. You can check out the current progress of the document with the link below.
